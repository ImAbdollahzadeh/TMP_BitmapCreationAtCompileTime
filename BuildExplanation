On VisualStudio 2015, Update 3, the build on Debug mode on x86, took 107 sec to complete (the whole build output 
has been provided in a separate file called BuildOverView).

The entire SmallBitmap creation is done at compile time. This is why with MS VC++ compiler, it is almost impossible to increase the pixel size of the final Bitmap arbitrarily
high.

On GCC 6.3 comiler, I could build and run up to 900 input pixels.
